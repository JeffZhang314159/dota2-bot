To use local bot scripts, just clone this repo (the lua files) into Steam/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/dota/scripts/vscripts/bots

Create lobby, set server location as "Local Host", set bots as "Local Dev Script"

Alternatively, use console commands. Run:
`map dota`

`jointeam spec`

`dota_bot_populate`
Unfortunately will not use hero_selection.lua
